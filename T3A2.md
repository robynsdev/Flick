# Description of your website, including:
- Purpose
    - We've been approached by Netflix to create an application that will reduce the time of users scrolling through their library and to make a decision quicker on which media to consume. The aim of the application will be to allow users to create watchlists, compare with their friends watchlists and to have a randomizer pick a choice to watch for them. Ultimately, this will lead to increased watching time as it reduces the friction of decision making especially if there are multiple parties involved, a very common issue with people in relationships deciding on what to watch. Having the data on what people are placing in their watchlists will allow Netflix to more accurately decide what content to include in their library and which licences to extend and which licences to forgo.

# User stories

## Persona 1 - Jason

![jason headshot](./Images/jason.png)

Jason is a single student with lots of leisure time in between studies. He loves to consume media and in particular watching movies and tv shows. He frequently has shows that he's been "meaning to watch" but does not get around to it and instead watches shows that he has already seen on repeat due to the familiarity

### Goal 
To help Jason keep track of things he wants to watch with a watchlist and then help him choose where to start if he has trouble deciding

### Motivations
Jason wants to be less boring and have more to talk about with others in terms of shows rather than having to rely on the same jokes from "The Office"

### User stories

As Jason I want to be able to view summaries of movies and shows and add them to a watchlist
As Jason I want to be able to create my own account and save my watchlist
As Jason I want to have someone/something else decide on what to watch next 
As Jason I want to see what my friends are interested in seeing and add them to my watchlist

## Persona 2 - Tiffany

Tiffany is a recent university graduate that has entered the workforce and has just moved in with her partner. She has an hour or two after work to be able to sit down and enjoy time with her partner and one of their favorite past times is to watch a new show or movie together. However, more often than not they spend most of the time scrolling through a never ending library of titles and never settle on anything or just rewatch something they're familiar with

### Goal
To help Tiffany and her partner to generate separate watchlists that we can compare and allow them to pick a title that they're both interested in. If they cannot decide the application will randomly choose one for them

### Motivations
Tiffany wants to have less arguments and be more decisive with what they're going to watch during their limited free time

### Goal
To help Adam's guests find a movie or show that they're all interested in/haven't watched before so that everyone can enjoy the night and Adam doesn't need to worry about whether someone is suffering in silence.

### Motivations
Adam wants to be his gatherings to be a blast for everyone and have an easy way to determine what to watch amongst a group of 6-10 people.
